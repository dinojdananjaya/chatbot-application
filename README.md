Chat bot application for AI Coursework 02

This is a creation of a Banking Assistant chatbot that aims at improving the efficiency of customer relations in banking through answering the most common banking questions. Implementing User Friendly Web Interface, Python Libraries, NLP, Machine Learning, Neural Networks and a highly developed relational database, this chatbot enables users to obtain reliable and up-todate information on account types, loans and current interest rates as well as other bankingrelated inquiries. Thus, the primary goal of this project will be to develop an efficient, easy to use chatbot that will not only enhance the overall experience for the customer but will also lessen the amount of stress on the live customer service agents. By using complex NLP tools and a neural network model, the chatbot can easily interpret the usersâ€™ queries and provide the necessary answers. The database that supports the backend for the chatbot is the Microsoft SQL Server 2014 which provides clean and efficient data management.
